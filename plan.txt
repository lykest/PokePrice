User supplies a .xls or .xlsx file in the format of:

Column A        Column D [opt]          Column E [opt]
Row 1 All Labels (Name... Type ... Markings ... EN count ... JP count ...)
<Card name>     <English card count>    <Japanese card count>

[opt] are not necessary, but the program will attempt to multiply the found
market values with the number of cards specified.
All columns except Columns A are optional.  Only names of pokemon are required.

The script will search the Mavin (https://mavin.io) database to retrieve
the estimated average market value, with the lowest and highest values
also retrieved for listing which are sold.

The search results generated from https://mavin.io/search?q=<card name>&bt=sold
returns the useful attributes we can read from:

#medianHiddenField
    Contains the "value" attribute with the average price for the item
    jQuery: $('#medianHiddenField').attr('value')
#lowestWorthItemHeader
    Contains the "data-sold" attribute with the lowest price sold
    jQuery: $('#lowestWorthItemHeader').attr('data-sold')
#highestWorthItemHeader
    Contains the "data-sold" attribute with the highest price sold
    jQuery: $('#highestWorthItemHeader').attr('data-sold')



Assumptions:
    If there is no English or Japanese card count for a given Card name,
    assume 1 for English

Program Steps:

1.  Read and verify XLS contents:
    First row are all assumed labels
    Duplicate names are allowed

2.  Perform a timed search using https://mavin.io
        If no results are returned, continue processing other entries
            Fill a 0.0 value for all values related to the card
        Assume rate limiting, so sleep for two seconds

3.  Write results
        Write to a predetermined output XLSX:
            Column A: Name of monster
            Column B: Lowest price of one card
            Column C: Highest price of one card
            Column D: Average price of one card
            Column E: Lowest price of all cards
            Column F: Highest price of all cards
            Column G: Average price of all cards

        Place in two lines after the end of the document:
            Total Average Price     ... Lowest ...      ... Highest ...
                $x                      $x                  $x
